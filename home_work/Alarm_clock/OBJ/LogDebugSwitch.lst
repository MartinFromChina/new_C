N这两个宏都可以用于获取当前函数名称，但它们在使用方式和适用范围上有所不同。 
N 
N __FUNCTION__  宏会在编译时被替换为当前函数的名称字符串，可以在任何函数中使用，包括全局作用域。但是它不是标准宏，不被所有编译器都支持。 
N 
N __func__  宏是C99标准的一部分，支持更广泛，并且也会在编译时被替换为当前函数的名称字符串。它只能在函数内使用，因此对于全局作用域或类作用域中的函数， __FUNCTION__  可能是更好的选择。 
N 
N因此，如果你的编译器支持  __FUNCTION__ ，并且你不需要跨编译器移植代码，则  __FUNCTION__  可以是更通用的选择。如果需要与不同类型的编译器和标准兼容，则应使用  __func__ 。

N*       RTT memcpy configuration
N*
N*       memcpy() is good for large amounts of data, 
N*       but the overhead is big for small amounts, which are usually stored via RTT.
N*       With SEGGER_RTT_MEMCPY_USE_BYTELOOP a simple byte loop can be used instead.
N*
N*       SEGGER_RTT_MEMCPY() can be used to replace standard memcpy() in RTT functions.
N*       This is may be required with memory access restrictions, 
N*       such as on Cortex-A devices with MMU.
